/*:

### 3. Pass a Closure
Instead of sorting the array in ascending order, modify your function to accept a closure that takes two arguments of the same type as the array’s contents, and returns Bool. You can name this closure parameter `isOrderedBefore` (as in the `sort` function of the standard library).
****
Also check what `@noescape` means in Swift.
****
Since you now use another function to do the comparison, you can remove the `Comparable` constraint.
