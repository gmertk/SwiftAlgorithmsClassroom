## Quicksort
 The most famous sorting algorithm. Invented by Tony Hoare. There is [a short interview with him telling his invention of quicksort](http://anothercasualcoder.blogspot.com.es/2015/03/my-quickshort-interview-with-sir-tony.html ). Read more about [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort ). We will go over two approaches here. First one is the real implementation of quicksort. Second one is less efficient but functional implementation with filters.

- [Quicksort In-place](Quicksort%20In-place)
- [Quicksort Functional](Quicksort%20Functional)
